# StarCraft
This is a pytorch implementation of the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, including [QMIX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485), [VDN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05296), [COMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926), and [QTRAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05408)(both QTRAN-base and QTRAN-alt), which are the state of art MARL algorithms. In addition, we implemented [CommNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736) and combined it with coma, which we called CommNet_COMA. We trained these algorithms on [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac), the decentralised micromanagement scenario of [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty).

## Quick Start

```shell
$ python main.py --evaluate_epoch=100 --map=3m --alg=qmix
```

Directly run the main.py, then the algorithm will be tested on map '3m' for 100 episodes, using the pretrained model.

## Result
Although QMIX, VDN, COMA and QTRAN are the state of art multi-agent algorithms, they are unstable sometimes. If you want the same results as in the papers, you need to independently run several times(more than 10) and take the median or mean of them.
